It's BRONTOSAURUS! 

Way back when scientists were madly digging up and naming dinosaurs, bearded paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh discovered and named a massive sauropod skeleton: the apatosaurus. Soon after, he found another, similar skeleton and named that one too: the brontosaurus. Here is an artist's rendering of Mr. Marsh.

Apatosaurus means "deceptive lizard." This name is no fun, and very few people felt the urge to say it more than once. The dinosaur was a flop. Brontosaurus, meanwhile, means "thunder lizard," and is awesome. This is the sauropod you've heard of. 

But trouble was brewing for brontosaurus. Some guy named Elmer --- a hairless man from Kansas with no marketing sense --- reviewed the two specimens and declared them the same species. Scientists were forced to abandon the second, better name. 

Unperturbed, brontosaurus went on to great success, dominating lunch boxes, gas stations and casual conversation for the next hundred years. Meanwhile, dorks everywhere delighted in the opportunity to correct preschoolers on their nomenclature.

Finally in 2015, vindication came when a team of smarter, modern scientists confirmed what children and film producers everywhere already knew, BRONTOSAURUS! is a real, fancy creature with great creative instincts, a knack for thriving in unconventional circumstances, and pretty eyes. 

Nowadays, BRONTOSAURUS! specializes in tv spots, delightful documentaries and leafy green creative development. Get in touch with BRONTOSAURUS! via e-mail, telephone, or by leaving large quantities of prepared foods unguarded and out in the open. 

In the end, Othniel Charles Marsh was returned his glory as an American hero and a scholar. Elmer, meanwhile, is dead.
