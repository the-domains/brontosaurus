  Some serious skills on display here by the staff of SJC on the snare, and on
  the table saw. Over a couple of days in Southbridge, MA, these guys designed
  and built a custom, one-of-a-kind drum head from the staves of a real Jack
  Daniel's whiskey barrel. The smells were incredible. Production was a one-man
  crew, using mostly available light and some safety goggles.
